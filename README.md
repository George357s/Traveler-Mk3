# Traveler-Mk3
A professional website, made from scratch
A clean, modern, minimalistic, and professional website made with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I had a lot of fun with this and some issues that I was able to resolve. Some of the things I learned from this project is how to -

- Build an advanced navbar with dropdown menu from scratch, only Javascript
- Build an automatic slider from scratch with pagination controls (No Libraries)
- Add some sleek scroll animations using Animate CSS & WOW JS
- Build complex layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Create a newsletter section
- Add smooth scrolling with CSS
- Create a clean card design with HTML & CSS
- Use CSS variables
- Make the design fully responsive on all screen sizes
